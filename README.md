LUNG CANCER DETECTION 

PROBLEM STATEMENT
addressing the challenges in the early identification of lung cancer by proposing an automated system using various Machine Learning (ML) and image processing techniques. 
This project has utilized a collection of images including different lung cancer types and healthy lung tissue.
 By analyzing this data, deep understanding has gained on its properties. Then, this study has tested two machine learning models. The proposed system's effectiveness in lung cancer detection is finally analyzed by using performance evaluation. 
Finally, the system is deployed with a user-friendly interface to aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing lung cancer. 


WHY LUNG CANCER?
Lung cancer remains a major challenge in the field of oncology and remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite significant advances in medical technology and therapy, the outlook for lung cancer patients continues to depend largely on prompt and accurate diagnosis. 



DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset is divided into three main folders: training, test and validation. Each of these folders has subfolders representing different types of lung tissue, including adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and normal tissue.

ALGORITHMS WE USED-

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a powerful supervised learning method that can be applied to regression and classification problems. It works well with both linearly and nonlinearly separable data because it defines an ideal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes in the feature space. SVM handles high-dimensional data well and is robust to overfitting.
 Random Forest: Random Forest, an ensemble learning technique, builds multiple decision trees during training. It then combines their predictions by taking the class mode (for classification) or the mean prediction (for regression). It should be noted that Random Forest is robust to oversampling and works efficiently with high-dimensional data. The method can be used for classification and regression, making it a versatile approach.

Evaluating parameters Several additional performance criteria are needed to evaluate the performance of a classification model. F1 score, precision, recall and support are some of these metrics, as shown in Figure 4. Taken as a whole, these metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance in lung cancer detection and provide insight into its ability to accurately detect different types of lung tissue while reducing false positives and false negatives.
